First things first.

You're gonna need some dynamic libraries (dylibs).

> libfragmentzip.dylib

> libipatcher.dylib

> liboffsetfinder.dylib

> libimg4tool.dylib

> libgeneral.dylib

I've included these in the ra1nsn0w folder. *You're welcome.*

You **could** run ra1nsn0w in the folder it's in, if you want. Or, you could copy the dylibs to /usr/local/lib, and run ra1nsn0w from wherever the hell you want. Up to you.

***If you run into problems:***

1: Blame Tihmstar.

2: Copy the error you get. **In full.**

3: Start an issue on Github, explain what you were doing, paste the error.

4: Wait for a solution.
